## Random Quote Machine

This is another of my FreeCodeCamp projects "Random Quote Machine". Its function is to generate a new quote by clicking on the "new quote" button. It was developed with ReactJs.

I didn't use any quote API, just declare a variable with random quotes.

I used external fonts like Bootstrap for some styles and Font Awesome for the icons.

If you want you can see the app in the following [link](https://luismgil.github.io/Random-quote-machine/).
